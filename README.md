## What Does the TrailMixr App Do?

The TrailMixr app plans multi-day hikes through user-specified trails in supported provincial parks. Using a proprietary algorithm that combines existing data with data gathered from our user base, the app calculates a **plan satisfaction score**, **ease-of-use score**, and **safety score** for each proposed route. This empowers users to confidently choose and execute their desired adventure.

### Plans Generated by TrailMixr Include:

- **The Route Traveled:** A detailed map and itinerary of your multi-day journey, including all trail segments.
- **Departure and Arrival Times/Dates:** Optimized start and end times for each day, tailored to your preferences and daylight hours.
- **User Position Tracking:** Estimated user position at any given time, calculated via dead-reckoning based on your plan and progress.
- **Tent Pitching & Rest Locations:** Suggested overnight and rest stops, optimized using topography, solar exposure, and soil data for comfort and safety.
- **Amenity Locations:** Marked locations for washrooms, fishing spots, and other useful amenities along your route.
- **Hazard Identification:** Alerts for potential hazards (e.g., difficult terrain, wildlife, water crossings) along your planned path.
- **Equipment Optimization:** Personalized equipment recommendations based on your route and conditions.
  - *Free users* receive standard recommendations with sponsored content.
  - *Premium users* get access to gear tested and recommended by TrailMixr experts, with no ads.
- **Backup Plans:** Alternative routes and contingency plans in case of emergencies or unexpected events.
- **Plan Closure Options:** Ability to "close" your plan upon completion. If you fail to close your plan, TrailMixr can automatically initiate a missing person report to authorities for your safety.

## How TrailMixr Generates Plans

To create safe, satisfying, and optimized multi-day hiking plans, TrailMixr's proprietary algorithm analyzes a wide range of data sources:

- **Weather Analysis:** Forecasts and historical weather data for your planned dates, ensuring your trip is safe and comfortable.
- **Topography:** Elevation and terrain data sourced from OpenTopography, used to optimize routes and rest locations.
- **Sunlight Irradiation:** Sun exposure data from OpenSun, helping to plan for daylight hours and ideal tent pitching spots.
- **Temperature:** Real-time and historical temperature data from Environment and Climate Canada, for safety and comfort.
- **Soil Conditions:** Soil type and quality data from GeoHub, used to recommend suitable camping and rest locations.
- **Animal Habitats:** Wildlife and habitat data from GeoHub, to help avoid sensitive or dangerous areas and support conservation.

By combining these data sources, TrailMixr ensures that every plan is not only enjoyable and efficient, but also safe and environmentally responsible.
